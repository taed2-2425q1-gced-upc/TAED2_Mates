# Reports Overview

This directory contains various reports and visual assets generated during the dog breed classification project. The reports provide insights into model performance, data checks, and visualizations used in presentations and analyses. The directory is divided into subfolders that organize different types of reports and figures.

The following sections describe the folder structure and the purpose of each subfolder and file.

## Subfolder and File Descriptions

### 1. `deepchecks/`
- **`train_val_split_check.html`**: This is an HTML report generated by the Deepchecks library, which evaluates the training and validation dataset splits. It provides detailed analysis on how well the dataset is split, highlighting any potential issues like class imbalances or distribution mismatches between the training and validation sets.

### 2. `figures/`
This subfolder contains various figures and images used for visualization and in presentations. Key files include:

- **`Competition_models.png`**: A figure showing the comparison between different models tested during the competition phase of the project.
- **`Competition_results.png`**: A chart that presents the performance results (e.g., accuracy, loss) of the models in the competition.
- **`example_image.jpg`**: An example image used for testing, demonstrations, or illustrations in presentations or the app.
- **`imbalanced_dataset.png`**: A visualization highlighting the class imbalances within the dataset, useful for understanding potential issues related to uneven representation of dog breeds in the dataset.

#### `streamlit/` Subfolder
This subfolder holds images that are specifically used within the Streamlit app developed for the project. The images include:

- **`assistance_1.jpg` to `assistance_27.jpg`**: A series of images showing interactions or interface elements of the assistance tool in the Streamlit app.
- **`footer.jpg`**: A footer image used in the Streamlit app for branding or aesthetic purposes.

## How to Use the Reports

1. **Deepchecks Report**: Open the `train_val_split_check.html` file in any web browser to review the train-validation split analysis. This report is useful for assessing the quality of the data split and identifying potential issues with the dataset.
   
2. **Figures for Presentations**: The figures in the `figures/` subfolder are intended for use in reports or presentations. Use them to visualize model performance, dataset characteristics, or demonstrate the Streamlit app.
