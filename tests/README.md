## File Descriptions

### 1. `test_images/`
This folder contains sample images used for testing image processing and model prediction functionalities. Each image serves as input for the corresponding tests to ensure that the model can handle and correctly classify various image formats.

- **Example Image**: 0021f9ceb3235effd7fcde7f7538ed62.jpg is one of the test images used in the validation process.

### 2. `test_*.py`
These Python files contain unit tests that check the correctness of various components of the project. Each file is designed to test a specific aspect of the codebase:

- **`test_api.py`**: Tests the API endpoints to ensure they return the correct responses and handle errors gracefully.
- **`test_create_batches.py`**: Validates the batch creation process, ensuring that data is split into the expected sizes and formats.
- **`test_create_model.py`**: Tests the model creation functions to confirm they initialize models with the correct parameters.
- **`test_get_label.py`**: Checks the functionality of label retrieval from data sources.
- **`test_load_model.py`**: Validates that models can be loaded correctly from saved files.
- **`test_load_params.py`**: Ensures that model parameters are loaded and applied as intended.
- **`test_load_processed_data.py`**: Tests the loading of preprocessed data, checking for format consistency and data integrity.
- **`test_model.py`**: Validates core model functions and ensures they produce the expected outputs.
- **`test_predict.py`**: Tests the prediction functionality of the model on a batch of data.
- **`test_predict_single.py`**: Validates prediction for individual data points.
- **`test_prepare.py`**: Ensures data is prepared correctly before being fed into the model.
- **`test_process_image.py`**: Tests image processing functions for correctness and efficiency.
- **`test_read_data.py`**: Validates data reading functions to ensure they load data correctly from various sources.
- **`test_read_labels.py`**: Tests the functionality of reading labels associated with the datasets.

### 3. `tests-report.xml`
This XML file contains the results of the test runs, providing a summary of passed and failed tests. It can be used for generating reports and tracking test coverage over time.

## How to Use the Tests

1. **Setup**: Ensure that all dependencies are installed and the environment is configured correctly. This includes any libraries required for running the tests (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest`, etc.).

2. **Running Tests**: You can execute the tests by navigating to the project directory and using the following command:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   This command will automatically discover and run all test files matching the `test_*.py` pattern.

3. **Reviewing Results**: After running the tests, review the output in the terminal or consult the `tests-report.xml` file for detailed results. Look for any failed tests and debug accordingly.

4. **Adding New Tests**: To enhance test coverage, you can create additional test files or extend existing ones. Ensure that each new test is focused on a single functionality to maintain clarity and effectiveness.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively validate the functionality of the project and contribute to maintaining a high standard of code quality.
