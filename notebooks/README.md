## Notebook Descriptions

### 1. `01_dataset_exploration.ipynb`
This notebook contains an exploratory analysis of the dataset used in the project. Key sections of this notebook include:
- Loading and visualizing the dataset (e.g., displaying sample images of different dog breeds)
- Analyzing dataset composition (e.g., the distribution of dog breeds, class frequencies)
- Checking for missing data or anomalies in the dataset
- Basic statistics and visualizations to understand the features (e.g., breed counts, image size distributions)

This notebook is essential for gaining insights into the structure and characteristics of the dataset before preprocessing and model development.
