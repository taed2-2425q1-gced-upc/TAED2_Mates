# Notebooks

## Overview

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and experimentation.

- Each notebook follows a clear naming convention.
- Notebooks are used for exploratory and early development work. Once stable, the reusable code is converted into Python scripts in `mates/`.


## Usage

- Keep notebooks organized and well documented.
- If a notebook depends on specific data files, include instructions on where to find the data or how to generate it.
